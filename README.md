Project Description: QuizQuest
QuizQuest is a fun and interactive Python-based quiz application that tests your knowledge of Python programming. The program presents a series of multiple-choice questions, evaluates your answers, and keeps track of your score. It also allows you to decide whether to continue to the next question or exit the quiz after each round.

Key Features:
1. ASCII Art Banner: The quiz starts with a stylish ASCII art banner generated using the pyfiglet library.

2. Multiple-Choice Questions: The quiz includes a variety of Python-related questions with four options each.

3. Score Tracking: Your score is calculated based on correct answers, with each correct answer adding 10 points.

4. User Control: After each question, you can choose to continue or exit the quiz.

5. Input Validation: The program ensures that only valid inputs (1, 2, 3, or 4) are accepted for answers and handles invalid inputs gracefully.
